=========================

A slightly confusing aspect of Sphinx is that for multi-file documentation to link to each section correctly, each file needs to be listed in the root table of contents.

This can be customized, which is a necessity for dynamic blog-style content, but it requires adjusting the sidebar code.

A typical place to put this root table of content is at the end of the index file, and it can also be hidden.
